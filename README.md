# Bamazon

## Node.js & MySQL

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront. The app takes orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. The Manager feautre allows you to check low stock, add products and update inventory. The Supervisor feature tracks product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
