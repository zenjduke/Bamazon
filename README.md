# Bamazon

## Overview Node.js & MySQL

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

## Submission Guide

Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.

* Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works. 

* Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.

## Instructions


3. Modify your `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product's product_sales column.

* Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the `products` column.

4. Create another Node app called `bamazonSupervisor.js`. Running this application will list a set of menu options:

* View Product Sales by Department

* Create New Department

5. When a supervisor selects `View Product Sales by Department`, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.

| department_id | department_name | over_head_costs | product_sales | total_profit |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 01            | Electronics     | 10000           | 20000         | 10000        |
| 02            | Clothing        | 60000           | 100000        | 40000        |

6. The `total_profit` column should be calculated on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `product_sales`. `total_profit` should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias.

7. If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add `total_profit` to the `departments` table.

* Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL.

* Hint: You may need to look into GROUP BYs.

* Hint: You may need to look into JOINS.

* **HINT**: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What's is it? Good question :)
